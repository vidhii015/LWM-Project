        <h1>London Wealth Management’s history</h1>
        <div class="wrapper">
          <p>
            London Wealth Management was founded by Paul Hoban, Ben Howland and
            Edward Tudor each of whom have worked together at larger financial
            advisory firms for a decade prior to founding LWM. Our mission was
            to create a better way to deliver a service that combines financial
            planning and investment management. London Wealth Management was
            established with serving clients interests at the heart of
            everything we do, with the belief that every client deserves and
            needs a personal service.
          </p>
          <p>
            London Wealth Management was established in 2008 during what has now
            become known as the Global Financial Crisis. London Wealth
            Management has subsequently been through several global and economic
            shocks such as the Euro crisis, Brexit, the US election, the
            COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the cost of
            living crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Financial Planning led Investment Management service has proven
            robust in the most volatile periods of modern times. We pride
            ourselves on having a strong corporate culture and are always
            updating our work processes, continually improving and evolving with
            changing regulation and client needs.
